A major search and rescue operation is continuing through the night in Texas after flash floods killed at least 24 people and left many girls missing from a Christian summer camp.
There was little warning as the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet (7.9m) in less than an hour and flooding that followed swept away mobile homes, vehicles and holiday cabins where people were spending the 4 July weekend.
Rescue crews are still searching for up to 25 children who were among the 750 girls attending the Camp Mystic just outside the town of Kerrville 104km (64.0 miles) north-west of San Antonio.
A state of emergency has been declared in several counties where several roads have been washed away and phone lines are down.
US President Donald Trump called the tragedy "shocking" and "terrible" as the White House pledged additional assistance.
Pictures show the deep flood waters swamping bridges and fast moving water swirling down roads.
Eyewitness Bud Bolton recounted the moment floodwaters swept through a recreational vehicle (RV) park in Kerrville.
"(They were) caught inside that RV, and that RV's floating away," he told the San Antonio Express News. "And kids are screaming, and you can't do nothing for them."
Park resident Thomas Rux told the paper he was woken by thunder and rain and then told to evacuate by the fire department late in the night. Moments later his vehicle was swept away by the aggressive flood waters.
Restaurant owner Lorena added: "It's total devastation. Helicopters are flying in, rescuing people trapped in trees. It's bad."
Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said: "Within 45 minutes, the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet and it was a destructive flood, taking property and sadly lives."
He also informed parents that if they had not been contacted, their child was accounted for.
"That does not mean [the missing children] have been lost. They could be out of communication," Patrick added.
According to Camp Mystic's website, children become eligible to attend after completing second grade.
Officials said search and rescue operations, involving helicopters, drones and boats, would continue until everyone had been accounted for.
The camp said they had no power, no water and no Wi-Fi , adding that "the highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help".
On Friday morning, flash flooding in the state prompted disaster declarations for the Hill Country and Concho Valley regions.
Kerr County's most senior official, Judge Rob Kelly, was asked during a news conference as to why camps along the Guadalupe River had not been evacuated in advance.
"We didn't know this flood was coming. Rest assured, no-one knew this kind of flood was coming," Kelly said.
He then added "we do not have a warning system" in the area. Kelly added what happened on Friday far surpassed a flood in 1987, which killed 10 teenagers on a church camp bus near the town of Comfort, south of Kerr County.
According to the BBC's US partner CBS News, the Texas Division of Emergency Management had multiple meetings on Thursday to prepare, but officials said the National Weather Service "did not predict the amount of rain that we saw".
Original estimates were of up to 8 inches (20cm) of rain.
Officials said they were still concerned about the weather, adding that "if you do not live in area, do not come".
Kerr County Sheriff's Office told residents near creeks, streams and the Guadalupe River to move to higher ground.

## River Seine reopens to swimmers in Paris after century-long ban

- 요약: For the first time in more than 100 years people will be able to swim legally in three sections of the river.

### 본문
The River Seine in Paris has reopened publicly to swimmers for the first time since 1923 after a century-long ban.
The seasonal opening of the Seine for swimming is viewed as a key legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, when open water swimmers and triathletes competed in its waters which were specially cleaned for the event.
On Saturday morning at 08:00 local time (07:00 BST) a few dozen swimmers arrived ahead of the opening and dived into the water when they were able to do so.
There are three designated areas for public swimming in the Seine - one near the Eiffel Tower, another close to Notre Dame Cathedral and a third in eastern Paris.
Zones have changing rooms, showers, and beach-style furniture, which allow for up to 300 people to lay out their towels.
Until the end of August, the three swimming sites will be open for free at scheduled times to anyone with a minimum age of 10 or 14 years, depending on the location.
Lifeguards will also be present keeping an eye on those in the river.
The promise to lift the swimming ban dates back to 1988, when then-mayor of Paris and future president Jacques Chirac first advocated for its reversal.
Improvements over the last 20 years have already led to a sharp reduction in faecal bacteria entering the river.
For 100 years swimming was banned in the river because of the levels of water pollution that could make people ill.
Ahead of last summer's Olympics more than €1.4bn (£1.2bn; $1.6bn) was invested into cleaning up the Seine.
But, in the lead up to the games there were doubts as to whether the River Seine would be ready for the Olympics after it was revealed it failed water quality tests.
Organisers blamed rainfall for the increased pollution which limited athletes' abilities to train for the triathlon, marathon swimming and paratriathlon.
Last July, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and other members of the Olympic committee went into the Seine to prove that it was safe to swim in.

- 요약: "Julian loved life," said the wife of the actor best known for roles in Nip/Tuck, FBI: Most Wanted and Fantastic Four.

Australian actor Julian McMahon, famed for roles in popular series like Nip/Tuck and Charmed, has died aged 56.
His wife said the actor passed away in Clearwater, Florida, on Wednesday. He had been diagnosed with cancer.
"Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible," Kelly Paniagua said in a statement carried by Deadline.
McMahon's career took off with the hit supernatural television series Charmed before he gained wider recognition with Nip/Tuck, the medical drama in which he played the role of plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy.
Running for six seasons from 2003 to 2010, the show earned him a Golden Globe nomination.
Co-star Dylan Walsh told Dealine he was "stunned".
"We rode this wave together and I loved him.
"Jules! I know you'd want me to say something to make you smile — all the inside jokes. All those years you had my back, and my god, we laughed. My heart is with you. Rest in peace."
McMahon also played Doctor Doom in two Fantastic Four films in 2005 and 2007 and later appeared in three seasons of FBI: Most Wanted.
Dick Wolf, the producer of FBI: Most Wanted, said McMahon's death was "shocking news".
McMahon was the son of a former Australian prime minister and went on to play an Australian prime minister's role in Netflix's The Residence - one of his recent appearances.
McMahon married three times - the first to Australian singer-actress Dannii Minogue, sister of Kylie Minogue.
