- 요약: The group says it is ready to begin negotiations immediately, as Donald Trump says there can possibly be a deal next week.

Hamas says it has delivered a "positive response" to mediators on the latest proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal put forward by the US.
The Palestinian armed group said on Friday night that it was "seriously ready to enter immediately into a round of negotiations", but it did not confirm whether it accepted the terms.
A senior Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas had requested several changes, including a halt to a US-backed aid system and a US guarantee that the war would not resume if talks on ending the war failed.
Israel's government has not commented. US President Donald Trump said he had not been briefed but that it was "good" Hamas had responded positively.
"There could be a Gaza deal next week," he told reporters on board Air Force One.
The president is known to be very keen to announce positive news when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House next week.
On Tuesday, Trump said that Israel had accepted the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire, during which the parties would work to end the war.
The plan is believed to include the staggered release of 10 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and the bodies of 18 other hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Fifty hostages are still being held in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive.
The proposal also reportedly says sufficient quantities of aid would enter Gaza immediately with the involvement of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The Palestinian official said Hamas was demanding aid be distributed exclusively by the UN and its partners, and that the controversial aid distribution system run by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) end immediately.
Another amendment demanded by Hamas was about Israeli troop withdrawals, according to the Palestinian official.
The US proposal is believed to include phased pull-outs from parts of Gaza. But the official said Hamas wanted troops to return to the positions they held before the last ceasefire collapsed in March, when Israel resumed its offensive.
The official said Hamas also wanted a US guarantee that Israeli air and ground operations would not resume even if the ceasefire ended without a permanent truce.
The proposal is believed to say mediators will guarantee that serious negotiations will take place from day one, and that they can extend the ceasefire if necessary.
The Israeli prime minister has ruled out ending the war until all of the hostages are released and Hamas's military and governing capabilities are destroyed.
Far-right ministers have also expressed their opposition to the proposed deal. They want Israeli operations to be stepped up and for aid deliveries to be suspended.
The Israeli military continued to bomb targets across the Gaza Strip on Friday.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in the afternoon that Israeli attacks had killed at least 138 Palestinians over the previous 24 hours.
On Thursday night, at least 15 Palestinians were killed in strikes on two tents housing displaced people in the southern Khan Younis area, the local Nasser hospital said.
Thirteen-year-old Mayar al-Farr's brother, Mahmoud, was among those killed.
"There should have been a ceasefire long ago before I lost my brother," she told Reuters news agency at his funeral.
Adlar Mouamar, whose nephew Ashraf was also killed, said: "Our hearts are broken... We want them to end the bloodshed."
The Israeli military has not yet commented on the strikes, but did say its forces were "operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities".
Meanwhile, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said a former colleague was one of at least 16 people killed on Thursday when Israeli forces reportedly fired on people waiting for aid lorries in Khan Younis. The Israeli military has not yet commented.
The UN human rights office said on Friday that it had recorded the killing of 509 people near the GHF's aid distribution centres and 104 other people near aid convoys.
A spokeswoman said the office was working to verify the figures and ascertain who was responsible, but that it was "clear that the Israeli military has shelled and shot at Palestinians trying to reach the distribution points".
The GHF said the UN figures were coming "directly" from Gaza's health ministry and were being used to "falsely smear" its efforts. Its chairman insisted this week there had not been any violent incidents at or in close proximity to its sites.
The Israeli military has said reports of "extensive" casualties at the GHF's sites are "lies".
In the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, the families of the remaining hostages and their supporters held a rally outside the US embassy branch office on Friday, urging Trump to "make the deal" that would see them all released.
On the nearby beachfront, they laid out a giant banner featuring the US flag and the words "liberty for all".
Among those who addressed the event was Ruby Chen, the father of Israeli-American Itay Chen. The 19-year-old soldier was killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 which triggered the war, and his body was taken back to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israeli military.
"I urge you Prime Minister Netanyahu to go to the US next week and bring back a deal that brings all the hostages home," Mr Chen said.
Keith Siegel, an Israeli American who was released in February during the last ceasefire after 484 days in captivity, said: "Only a comprehensive deal can bring them all home and create a better future for the Middle East."
The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 57,268 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

## Australian PM vows 'full force of law' after arson attack at synagogue

- 요약: “Antisemitism has no place in Australia,” Anthony Albanese said after the latest in a string of attacks.

### 본문
Australia's prime minister has promised to take strong action following an apparent arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne.
Police are looking for a man who poured liquid on the synagogue's front door before setting it on fire on Friday night. Some 20 people having dinner inside at the time were evacuated without any injuries.
Police are also trying to determine if the incident is linked to an attack against a Jewish-owned restaurant in the city on the same night.
A string of antisemitic attacks have occurred in Australia in the past few months, sparked by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.
The Australian government has appointed a special envoy to combat antisemitism, and passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of high-profile attacks.
"Antisemitism has no place in Australia," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said following the attack on the East Melbourne synagogue.
"Those responsible for these shocking acts must face the full force of the law and my government will provide all necessary support toward this effort," Albanese said.
It is not clear if the incident was linked to the attack on the Miznon restaurant in the city's business district during which rioters broke in, throwing chairs and other objects while chanting "death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]". Some of  the attackers were led away in handcuffs.
"These events are a severe escalation directed towards our community," said Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.
"There have been too many antisemitic attacks in Australia," Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said.
"The Australian government must do more to fight this toxic disease."
The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has become a volatile political issue in Australia.
It has resulted in protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism.
The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 57,268 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

## River Seine reopens to swimmers in Paris after century-long ban

- 요약: For the first time in more than 100 years people will be able to swim legally in three sections of the river.

### 본문
The River Seine in Paris has reopened publicly to swimmers for the first time since 1923 after a century-long ban.
The seasonal opening of the Seine for swimming is viewed as a key legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, when open water swimmers and triathletes competed in its waters which were specially cleaned for the event.
On Saturday morning at 08:00 local time (07:00 BST) a few dozen swimmers arrived ahead of the opening and dived into the water when they were able to do so.
There are three designated areas for public swimming in the Seine - one near the Eiffel Tower, another close to Notre Dame Cathedral and a third in eastern Paris.
Zones have changing rooms, showers, and beach-style furniture, which allow for up to 300 people to lay out their towels.
Until the end of August, the three swimming sites will be open for free at scheduled times to anyone with a minimum age of 10 or 14 years, depending on the location.
Lifeguards will also be present keeping an eye on those in the river.
The promise to lift the swimming ban dates back to 1988, when then-mayor of Paris and future president Jacques Chirac first advocated for its reversal.
Improvements over the last 20 years have already led to a sharp reduction in faecal bacteria entering the river.
For 100 years swimming was banned in the river because of the levels of water pollution that could make people ill.
Ahead of last summer's Olympics more than €1.4bn (£1.2bn; $1.6bn) was invested into cleaning up the Seine.
But, in the lead up to the games there were doubts as to whether the River Seine would be ready for the Olympics after it was revealed it failed water quality tests.
Organisers blamed rainfall for the increased pollution which limited athletes' abilities to train for the triathlon, marathon swimming and paratriathlon.
Last July, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and other members of the Olympic committee went into the Seine to prove that it was safe to swim in.

- 요약: "Julian loved life," said the wife of the actor best known for roles in Nip/Tuck, FBI: Most Wanted and Fantastic Four.

### 본문
Australian actor Julian McMahon, famed for roles in popular series like Nip/Tuck and Charmed, has died aged 56.
His wife said the actor passed away in Clearwater, Florida, on Wednesday. He had been diagnosed with cancer.
"Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible," Kelly Paniagua said in a statement carried by Deadline.
McMahon's career took off with the hit supernatural television series Charmed before he gained wider recognition with Nip/Tuck, the medical drama in which he played the role of plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy.
Running for six seasons from 2003 to 2010, the show earned him a Golden Globe nomination.
Co-star Dylan Walsh told Dealine he was "stunned".
"We rode this wave together and I loved him.
"Jules! I know you'd want me to say something to make you smile — all the inside jokes. All those years you had my back, and my god, we laughed. My heart is with you. Rest in peace."
McMahon also played Doctor Doom in two Fantastic Four films in 2005 and 2007 and later appeared in three seasons of FBI: Most Wanted.
Dick Wolf, the producer of FBI: Most Wanted, said McMahon's death was "shocking news".
McMahon was the son of a former Australian prime minister and went on to play an Australian prime minister's role in Netflix's The Residence - one of his recent appearances.
McMahon married three times - the first to Australian singer-actress Dannii Minogue, sister of Kylie Minogue.
